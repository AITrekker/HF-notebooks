The easiest one revolves around using the [`jax.pmap`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.pmap.html) function to achieve single-program multiple-data (SPMD) parallelization. It means running several copies of the same code, each on different data inputs. More sophisticated approaches are possible, and you can go over to the JAX [documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to explore this topic in more detail if you are interested!\n",

    "2. Ensures the compiled code runs in parallel on all available devices.\n",

    "1. Make a copy of the underlying function, `pipeline._generate`, on each device.\n",
    "2. Send each device a different portion of the input arguments (this is why it's necessary to call the *shard* function). In this case, `prompt_ids` has shape `(8, 1, 77, 768)` so the array is split into 8 and each copy of `_generate` receives an input with shape `(1, 77, 768)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to pay attention to here is the batch size (1 in this example), and the input dimensions that make sense for your code. You don't have to change anything else to make the code work in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you call the pipeline takes more time, but the calls afterward are much faster. The `block_until_ready` function is used to correctly measure inference time because JAX uses asynchronous dispatch and returns control to the Python loop as soon as it can. You don't need to use that in your code; blocking occurs automatically when you want to use the result of a computation that has not yet been materialized."
