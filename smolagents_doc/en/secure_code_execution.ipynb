    "\n",
    "Why is code better? Well, because we crafted our code languages specifically to be great at expressing actions performed by a computer. If JSON snippets were a better way, this package would have been written in JSON snippets and the devil would be laughing at us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is just a better way to express actions on a computer. It has better:\n",
    "- **Composability:** could you nest JSON actions within each other, or define a set of JSON actions to re-use later, the same way you could just define a python function?\n",
    "- **Object management:** how do you store the output of an action like `generate_image` in JSON?\n",
    "- **Generality:** code is built to express simply anything you can have a computer do.\n",
    "- **Representation in LLM training corpus:** why not leverage this benediction of the sky that plenty of quality actions have already been included in LLM training corpus?\n",

    "By default, the `CodeAgent` runs LLM-generated code in your environment.\n",

    "This is inherently risky, LLM-generated code could be harmful to your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Malicious code execution can occur in several ways:\n",
    "- **Plain LLM error:** LLMs are still far from perfect and may unintentionally generate harmful commands while attempting to be helpful. While this risk is low, instances have been observed where an LLM attempted to execute potentially dangerous code.  \n",
    "- **Supply chain attack:** Running an untrusted or compromised LLM could expose a system to harmful code generation. While this risk is extremely low when using well-known models on secure inference infrastructure, it remains a theoretical possibility.  \n",
    "- **Prompt injection:** an agent browsing the web could arrive on a malicious website that contains harmful instructions, thus injecting an attack into the agent's memory\n",
    "- **Exploitation of publicly accessible agents:** Agents exposed to the public can be misused by malicious actors to execute harmful code. Attackers may craft adversarial inputs to exploit the agent's execution capabilities, leading to unintended consequences.\n",
    "Once malicious code is executed, whether accidentally or intentionally, it can damage the file system, exploit local or cloud-based resources, abuse API services, and even compromise network security.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that on the [spectrum of agency](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/tutorials/../conceptual_guides/intro_agents), code agents give much higher agency to the LLM on your system than other less agentic setups: this goes hand-in-hand with higher risk.\n",

    "We have re-built a more secure `LocalPythonExecutor` from the ground up.\n",

    "- Furthermore, access to submodules is disabled by default, and each must be explicitly authorized in the import list as well.\n",

    " - The total count of elementary operations processed is capped to prevent infinite loops and resource bloating.\n",
    " - Any operation that has not been explicitly defined in our custom interpreter will raise an error.\n",
